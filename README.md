data_clean.py: We cleaned the data and created labels so the data can suit the Naive Bayes and the Logistic Regression. 



feature_extraction.py: Functions we are going to use to parse the datasets, split data into training and test set, and convert labels to a vector y, mapped to 0 and 1

model.py: Train and evaluate the Naive Bayes model and the Logistic Regression model. And compare their performance on three datasets.
